# LAZYGIT😴🔥
A git based app trying to make source control easier for people like me who doesnt have a clue about what to do with git.

## Installation🔌
```sh
git clone https://github.com/bcbro2021/lazygit.git
cd lazygit
sh install.sh
```
Thats it!
## Getting Started🧐
Let's say you have a repo already and a project that is the clone of that repo and you would like to commit your changes to your repo
```sh
cd <your-project/repo-name>
lazygit deploy
```
And you're done! Your changes should be changed.
